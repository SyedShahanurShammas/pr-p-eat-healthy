            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="margin: 8px;">Hello!This is Syed Shahanur Shammas,
                I love eating food.Especially Healthy food. That's why I can say that I am foody.
                I try not to eat jhank food, But most of the time I have to eat them because of the circumstanses.I am
                bangladeshi, we usually eat rice.it has very good amount of energy.But it's tough to avoid unhealthy
                food.Unhealthy food is every where in bangladesh.So I will eat healthy food as much as I can.
            </p>

        <h1>My Recipe</h1>
        <p>Whether you are transitioning back to a workplace or not this summer, you’ve still likely got way more on
            <br>
            your plate (and more plates to fill) day in, day out. Which can make dinnertime feel like more of a <br>
            production than it should. Wouldn’t it be great if someone came along with a list of ways to streamline
            the <br>
            process, saving you time and buying you back a little sanity

            <p>
                Beans can be super versatile in quick meals, but if you are working with dried beans, you often have to
                remember to soak them overnight, which doesn’t make them fast food. Having some pre-soaked beans at the
                ready is a terrific way to speed up some soulful home cooking. You can put the beans in the water and
                leave in the fridge for a couple of days so that they are waiting for you and not the other way around.

            <h2>My Recipe</h2>
            <p>
                If you are like me, your freezer has a good stash of heat-and-eat appetizers at the ready for
                spontaneous entertaining. But since there are no cocktail parties in our foreseeable futures, you can
                make a whole fun meal out of those pigs in blankets, mini quiches, cocktail meatballs and little phyllo
                or puff pastry delectables. Kids especially love a meal of mini dishes!
